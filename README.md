# Classes explained:

# What are Devil Fruits ?

Devil Fruits are mysterious, distinctive fruits scattered throughout the world, known for granting their eaters permanent superhuman powers and an equally permanent inability to swim. 

# What is Haki ?

Haki is a mysterious power that allows the user to utilize their own spiritual energy for various purposes.

It can be used to sense people's spiritual energy and predict their actions, give the user a protective coating of spiritual energy, and, for a certain group of "chosen ones", overpower the willpower of others.

All living beings in the world are capable of learning Haki; however, most people do not notice it or fail to awaken it.
